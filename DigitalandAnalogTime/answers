ans 1 - differnce between var and let

1)let and var variables work the same way when used in a function block.
      function aSampleFunction(){
      
let letVariable = "Hey! What's up? I am let variable.";
var varVariable = "Hey! How are you? I am var variable.";

console.log(letVariable); //Hey! What's up? I am let variable.
console.log(varVariable); //Hey! How are you? I am var variable.
}

2) let variables cannot be re-declared while var variable can be re-declared in the same scope.
Assume we are using strict mode

2)let and var variables work the same way when defined globally but difference is let will not be 
included in window object and var will be included

3) let uses block scope , it is accesable only within its block (within curly brackets not outside it)
   ex- 
   for(let i = 0; i<10; i++) {
        console.log(i) // printing values from 0 to 9
        }
      console.log(i) // error let variable not accessible outside its scope
      
 4) a) var variable is part of window object it can be accessed using window object 
  example - var x = 10;
           console.log(window.x) // ans = 10
    b) let and const both are not part of window object
    
   
 ans 2 - situation where we have to use var instead of let
 
 suppose I want to console.log the last value of i in this loop so I cannot use let beacuse then
 variable i won't be availabe ouside for loop
 
 for(var i = 0; i<10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
        }
console.log(i) // ans 10


ans 3 - in how many ways we can access object

 1) using .dot notation
 
 const hero = {
  name: 'Batman'
};

// Dot property accessor
hero.name; // => 'Batman'


2) using Square brackets

const property = 'name';
const hero = {
  name: 'Batman'
};

// Square brackets property accessor:
hero['name'];   // => 'Batman'
hero[property]; // => 'Batman'

3)Object destructuring

const hero = {
  name: 'Batman'
};

// Object destructuring:
const { name } = hero;
name; // => 'Batman'

using loops

let nyc = {
fullName: "New York City",
mayor: "Bill de Blasio",
population: 8000000
};

for(let key in nyc){
console.log(key + " : " +nyc[key]);
}
